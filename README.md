# AppointmentBooker

AppointmentBooker is an implementation of a dynamic calendar. Users can input their availability for a given
day, add and delete calendar bookings, and print all their current bookings.

Availability for a particular day is dynamically updated as bookings are added by the user. If the user attempts to
add conflicting bookings, those bookings will not be added and the user will be notified.

Users are prompted to either enter a date to begin adding a booking, <Bookings> to view all current bookings,
<Openings> to view current openings, <Add> to input availability for a particular date, or <Delete> to delete a
particular booking.
